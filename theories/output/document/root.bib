  abstract      = {Model inference from system traces, e.g. for analysing
                  legacy components or generating security tests for
                  distributed components, is a common problem. Extended
                  Finite State Machine (EFSM) models, managing an internal
                  state as a set of registers, are particular well suited for
                  capturing the behaviour of stateful components however,
                  existing inference techniques for (E)FSMs lack the ability
                  to infer the internal state and its updates functions.

                  In this paper, we present a novel approach for inferring
                  EFSMs from system traces that also infers the updates of
                  the internal state. Our approach supports the merging of
                  transitions that update the internal data state. Finally,
                  our model is formalised in Isabelle/HOL, allowing for the
                  machine-checked verification of system properties.},
