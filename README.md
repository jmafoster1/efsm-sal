# EFSM SAL

EFSM models fit nicely with the notion of model checking. We can therefore express properties over EFSMs in LTL and check that these properties are true with SAL.

In order to run SAL on these examples, you need to have the `lib` directory location in your `SALCONTEXTPATH` environment variable. You can set this variable in your `.bashrc` file if you're using bash. If you're not using bash, you're on your own!
